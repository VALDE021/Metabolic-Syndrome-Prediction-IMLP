Authored by: Eric N. Valdez
 
## Assignment:
My task here was to predict metabolic syndrome based on common risk factors. I used the dataset [Metabolic Syndrome Prediction - dataset by informatics-edu](https://data.world/informatics-edu/metabolic-syndrome-prediction), which came from the data.world.

## Permutation Importance

Started looking at the Plotting the Permutation Importance

![]('Image/Permutation Importance.png')

Describe the feature engineering approaches you applied/tried

Include a plot of the permutation importance

Visualizations from part 1 (explanatory visualization of 2 of the 10 ten most important features)

Include the summary of your neural network, training metrics, and final evaluation metrics

Compare your machine learning results with your neural network results

Which was your best model, and which would you recommend for production?
